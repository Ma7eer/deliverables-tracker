# Deliverables Tracker

This is a demo application that I am building to learn Angular in preparation for an upcoming project.

The project is a deliverables tracker that will list deliverables for a particular project and their status.

## User Story

- The user can view a list of projects
- The user can perform CRUD operations on the projects
- Each project can send you to another page
- This other page has a list of deliverable
- Each deliverable can be toggled (approved, pending approval, not sent yet)
- We can perform CRUD on the deliverable
- We can add a link to send us to the deliverable

## Resource

A list of resources I kept going back to in order to build this project (not including stack overflow):
